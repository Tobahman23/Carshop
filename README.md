This project wasn't necessarily my best one, in fact it was probably one of the worse projects i've had since there's not really much to the site. BUT the project
was a good stepping stone for me to develop a better understanding to objects and api, and if you look at this project and than look at my movie project, you can see that 
I developed more skills using Apis in that project much thanks to me actually trying to learn more about objects and Apis in this project. So even if this isn't my best 
project it has helped me develop a much better understanding for how objects and apis work to the core.
